The testhw and the Testing directory are available for use in ~ssdavis/40/p4.
The design checker does not check for proper consts.  I will modify it
before applying it to the files you submit, so it does check consts.
So make sure you have const everywhere appropriate.
Copy testhw to one of your own directories.
There is no need to copy the Testing directory.
testhw takes only one argument--the directory that holds your CPU source code.
testhw will run the style checker, design checker, and operations checker, and
place all of the results in a series of result* files in the directory with the
source code in it.
